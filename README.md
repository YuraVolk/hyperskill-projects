# My Hyperskill Projects

This repository contains my implementations of various projects from Hyperskill. Each project is organized by track and stage.
1. Frontend.
   * Projects completed: 9.
   * Projects published in this repository: 7.
2. Java.
   * Projects completed: 26.
   * Projects published in this repository: 2.
3. Kotlin.
   * Projects completed: 12.
   * Projects published in this repository: 7.
  
Please note that this list does not include outdated and updated project versions, which actually increase project count.
The projects range through all difficulties as stated on Hyperskill:
1. Easy.
2. Medium.
3. Hard.
4. Challenging.

Because of the varying project difficulties, the projects are only grouped by language. Since tracks and difficulties may change, they're unstable for grouping projects, but language is very stable and avoids name repetition.
